Combining their distinctive producing skills, **Misanthrop** and **Aqua Luminus III** (Equinox Records, 88:Komaflash), both from Munich (Germany) created an astonishing 5 track EP that will appeal to both groups of listeners: abstract Hip-Hop heads and Electronica lovers. Although this is the first project at which the two artists and long time discjockeys worked together, they seem to harmonize perfectly. The diverse selection of samples, the heavy drum programming and crashing rhythms, plus the melodies and scratches – all this leads us to an uncommon but very unique and strong release.

The broad spectrum of sound colors on this limited edition picture vinyl 10” is reflected in the name “Leinwand” (German for canvas), whereas all names of the songs (e.g. “Giftgrün” (bilious green) or “Rabenschwarz” (black as a crow)) are coloquial German words for colors.

Additional information: This is the second vinyl only release on Audiac Records from Germany, the official sublabel of Equinox Records. The canvas artwork was done by **Aqua Luminus III** himself. The release is limited to 500 copies worldwide.
