6 years ago, Misanthrop & Aqua Luminus III. released the "Leinwand EP" on Audiac Records as a 10inch picture disc. With their new collaborative offering, under the self-explanatory title "6 Years Later EP", the two producers combine once again and provide another banging electronic Hip-Hop release. The new EP offers astonishing guest features such as underground hip hop legend 2Mex (Visionaries, SonGodSons), Fake Four's very own Ceschi and UK rapper James P Honey provide superb lyrics and flows on "20 Stories Later", the only non-instrumental track on the release. Additionally, the German turntablism legend DJ Stylewarz is cutting on "The 1 Billion Euro Song" alongside Munich's DJ icon Al Rock. Another skillful and mightily talented turntablist, SNTC, provides the scratching on "57 Bars Ahead".

Limited Edition 300 copies! 10inch with Picture Cover. Includes download card with 2 additional tracks.
